# k-meanscan also be used to find the threshold
# what it does is use the clustering approach , and  find differnt clusters
# and then depending upon these clusters we can find the threshold , which will seperate
# different classes.
#  The difference is typically based on pixel color, intensity, 
# texture, and location, or a weighted combination of these factors. 
# K can be selected manually, randomly, or by a heuristic.
